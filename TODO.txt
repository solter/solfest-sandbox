The war file generated inside solfest_sandbox_web/target
can be deployed to an application server.
The deployer folder contains a first pass attempt at using
a jetty embedded server to deploy the war on.
It does NOT work...
so finding an application server (or an embedded one to use)
is up to you.

Figure out how to write JUnit tests that
exercise the beans xml files at build time.

In this project there are two beans files:
    solfest_sandbox_web/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/solfest-sandbox-web-servlet.xml
    solfest_sandbox_web/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/trivial_beans.xml


Here is a useful entry point to spring:
    https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/

    chapter 7 covers the concept of IoC, beans files, and how spring works.
    part 4 covers testing spring - you will want to look at the integration
        testing stuff to exercise the beans files
