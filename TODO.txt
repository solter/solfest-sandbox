* update the freaking war pom to use the maven-assembly-plugin
  in conjunction with the maven-nar-plugin to package the nar output
  into the war.
  See the following resources:
  http://maven-nar.github.io/usage.html
  http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin/index.html
  http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin/usage.html

* deploy the war

	asadmin deploy jca-file-client.war

* test what happens when the native code segfaults
* set up the logback to see if you can get it working
* figure out how to set up maven to build a rar which deploys and sets up the jca/SolfestRA automagically
* get the resource adapter to actually call a native library
