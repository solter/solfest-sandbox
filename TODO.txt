* create the final build which assembles everything in the
  distro sub-module (which does not yet exist). The
  common, trivial_beans, jni_test, and solfest_sandbox_web
  submodules should be in a good working order now, and should
  be left alone.

  This will likely involve using the maven-assembly-plugin,
  as well as architecture specific assembly files.
  Here are some websites which may be useful:

* deploy the final assembled product

	asadmin deploy final_assembled_prod.?ar

* test what happens when the native code segfaults
* try to set up the logback inside the distro resources

If segfaults are problematic, the following steps must be taken
to set up a rar (see the master branch):
* figure out how to set up maven to build a rar which deploys 
  and sets up the jca/SolfestRA automagically
* get the resource adapter to actually call a native library
